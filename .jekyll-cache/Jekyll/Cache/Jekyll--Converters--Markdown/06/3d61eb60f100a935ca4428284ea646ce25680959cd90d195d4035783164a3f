I"—<p>In this post, I briefly introduce what are <strong>deep neural networks</strong> (DNNs) and <strong>convolutional neural networks</strong> (CNNs). There is no math involved. This should be a good refresher if you are already familiar with DNNs and CNNs. If not, at the end of this post, you could gain an intuitive understanding of the motivation behind CNN and the key components that define a CNN.</p>
