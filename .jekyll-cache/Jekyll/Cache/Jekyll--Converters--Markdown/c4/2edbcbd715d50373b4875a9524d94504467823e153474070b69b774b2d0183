I"0<p><strong>Any conclusion drawn from the data should be viewed with caution due to the dynamic nature of a pandemic and the adundant sources of bias associated with reporting.</strong> 
I update every morning the COVID-19 situation in the US, Europe, and Asia, tracking both the outbreak and any emerging signal of containment. The intent of this blog is not to feed daily news, but to present underlying trends and perspectives worth considering when reading the news. The graphs in this blog are best viewed on a Laptop browser. Latest update: April 05, 2020.</p>

<h2 id="1-prognosis">1. Prognosis</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>United States</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>The increase of new cases is slowing down <a href="#Percentage Change">(15%)</a>, as the strategy of ‚ÄúTest! Test! Test!‚Äù proves key to know the real-time situation on the ground. US has conducted more than 1.1 million tests over the past ten days, or on average, 110,000 per day. The <a href="#US Testing Numbers">number of tests pending results</a> also dropped from 61,980 to around 15,000.</li>
      <li>The case fatality rate (CFR) continues to rise, likely due to an increasingly overwhelmed healthcare system, especially in New York, New Jersey, and Michigan.</li>
      <li>On the upside, though, people are actively protecting themselves now as the <a href="#Google Search Interest">google search</a> for ‚Äúmask‚Äù is at an all-time high.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Europe</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>The containment efforts are taking effect as the number of cases is increasing at a <a href="#Percentage Change">slower rate every day</a>, with Italy, the slowest, at 5%, and Spain, the fastest, at 9%.</li>
      <li>The Italian healthcare system is still facing a grave challenge, with the case fatality rate (CFR) currently at 12%. Spain seems to be heading <a href="#case fatality rate">in the same direction</a> with a 10% CFR. Howeverm there are signs that the CFRs are slowing down.</li>
      <li>Germany and Switzerland, on the other hand, fare well in this regard and manage to record a 1.3% and 2.8% CFR, respectively. Austria, too, has managed one of the lowerest CFRs (1.4%) among European nations. (Austria, Germany, and a large part of Switzerland are all German-speaking.ü§î) Note there are caveats to reporting naive CFR which I <a href="case fatality rate">explain below</a>.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Asia</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>The cases in Japan are rapidly rising, approaching a 10% <a href="#Percentage Change">day-on-day growth rate</a>.</li>
      <li>One thing to note, we could almost cerntainly say that Japan is undertesting its population to know what is really going on. Assuming the true CFR is 1.2%<sup id="fnref:diamond_princess"><a href="#fn:diamond_princess" class="footnote">1</a></sup>, Japan‚Äôs current fatality number, 77, indicates that at least 6,417 people have been infected. However, only 3,139 cases are officially confirmed as of now.</li>
      <li>For the first time, Singapore is going into a national ‚ÄúShelter in Place‚Äù mode. The timeing is not surprising as some degree of wide-spread community infection is going on. The number of unlinked cases, those yet to find the source of infection, spiked over the last few days; Singapore also recorded 12 new clusters of infection just over the past five days (One of them is right across the river from my house).

<p><a name="Percentage Change"></a></p>
<h3 id="percentage-change">Percentage Change</h3>
<p>Look out for the 7-day moving average of the day-on-day percentage change in confirmed cases. It is important to see both the current percentage change and its trend. To easily classify the situation, we can use the following scale<sup id="fnref:percentage"><a href="#fn:percentage" class="footnote">2</a></sup>:</p>
<ul>
  <li><script type="math/tex">r > 100\%</script>: <strong>Rapidly increasing</strong>. The total number of cases is doubling everyday.</li>
  <li><script type="math/tex">% <![CDATA[
10\% < r < 100\% %]]></script>: <strong>Increasing</strong>.</li>
  <li><script type="math/tex">% <![CDATA[
1\% < r < 10\% %]]></script>: <strong>Slowly increasing</strong>.</li>
  <li><script type="math/tex">% <![CDATA[
r < 1\% %]]></script>: <strong>Under control</strong>. There is almost no new case reported.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="things-to-note">Things to Note</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Japan had a turning point on 23rd March where the increase of cases started accelerating. Coincidently (or maybe not), Japan and I.O.C. officially anounced the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/24/sports/olympics/coronavirus-summer-olympics-postponed.html">postponement of Tokyo 2020</a> on the next day.</li>
  <li>Italy is seeing hope at the current 5% increasing rate, but there‚Äôs still some days to go to reach 1%. Germany, Spain and Switzerland seem to be following suit.</li>
  <li>The rates in China and Singapore are flattening, too, likely due to heightened arrival restriction and control.</li>
</ul>

<p><a name="Google Search Interest"></a></p>
<h3 id="google-search-interest">Google Search Interest</h3>
<p>This figure tells us how many people in the US are searching for keywords such as ‚Äúhand sanitizer‚Äù or ‚Äúsymptom‚Äù. I suspect that as the community spread of the virus is being contained, we can expect to see a drop in searches for words like ‚Äúsymptom‚Äù and ‚Äúinfluenza‚Äù, similar to the trends shown in Singapore. The rebound in Singapore has come after several new clusters of infection emerged over the last few days.</p>

<p><a name="US Testing Numbers"></a></p>
<h3 id="us-testing-numbers">US Testing Numbers</h3>
<p>As the containment takes effect, we expect to see the number of positive and negative tests stabilize, and the number of tests pending result drops. As you can see, we are not there yet.</p>
<iframe width="696" height="432" seamless="" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" src="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vQnqDux0h60qbKyhlYff1YMpjwhPZA694IOW4ixe0XNFi-JUHjXxJ69AFIGXajrBURwUKW2FnELgE1C/pubchart?oid=481777218&amp;format=interactive"></iframe>

<ul>
  <li>How does selection bias affect CFR?
    <blockquote>
      <p>[In Italy], a change in strategy on Feb 25 limited testing to patients who had severe signs and symptoms also resulted in a 19% positive rate (21,157 of 109,170 tested as of Mar 14) and an apparent increase in the death rate‚Äîfrom 3.1% on Feb 24 to 7.2% on Mar 17‚Äîpatients with milder illness were no longer tested.  In the UK, only patients deemed ill enough to require at least one night in hospital met the criteria for a Covid-19 test.</p>

      <p>CFR rates are subject to selection bias as more severe cases are tested, generally those in the hospital settings or those with more severe symptoms. The number of currently infected asymptomatics is uncertain: estimates put it at least a half are asymptomatic; the proportion not coming forward for testing is also highly doubtful (i.e. you are symptomatic, but you do not present for testing). Therefore we can assume the IFR is significantly lower than the CFR.</p>
    </blockquote>
  </li>
  <li>When is CFR accurate?
    <blockquote>
      <p>Iceland‚Äôs higher rates of testing, the smaller population, and their ability to ascertain all those with Sars-CoV-2  means they can obtain. an accurate estimate of the CFR and the infection fatality rate (IFR) during the pandemic (most countries will only be able to do this after the pandemic). Current data from Iceland suggests their IFR is somewhere between 0.01% and 0.19%.</p>
    </blockquote>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>The bottom line is, CFR is probably <strong>inflated</strong> in many countries and IFR is <strong>much lower</strong> than CFR.</p>
