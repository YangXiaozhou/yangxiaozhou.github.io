I"}<p>Hi, I am currently working on my Ph.D. in industrial engineering at National University of Singapore, under the supervision of A/P <a href="https://www.eng.nus.edu.sg/isem/staff/chen-nan/">Chen Nan</a>. I am also part of the <a href="http://www.frs.ethz.ch">Future Resilient Systems</a> program at <a href="https://sec.ethz.ch">Singapore-ETH Centre</a>. I am interested in condition monitoring problems for complex physical systems using data-driven methods. When I am not working, I like doing <a href="https://www.strava.com/athletes/29332455/">sports</a>. I also go hiking and scuba diving around South East Asia.</p>

<p>Growing up, my dad would always tell me that “好记性不如烂笔头”, which means that the palest ink is better than the best memory. He is a man of words. I can still remember vividly how he would sit in the living room and write in his journal every night. I am becoming increasingly aware of the fact that:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Writing stuff down forces me to organize and think deeper.</li>
  <li>I tend to quickly forget stuff.
<!-- - I am contributing freely to many UGC-platforms.  --></li>
</ul>

<p>So I decided to start this blog where I can put thoughts down and not worry about losing them.</p>

<p>I am putting my Strava widget here because I just love the app so much.</p>
