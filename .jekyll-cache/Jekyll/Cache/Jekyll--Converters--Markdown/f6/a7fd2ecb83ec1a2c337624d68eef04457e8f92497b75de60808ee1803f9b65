I"—<p>I am not a deep learning researcher, but Iâ€™ve come to know a few things about neural networks through various exposures. Iâ€™ve always heard that CNN is a type of neural network thatâ€™s particularly good at image-related problems. But, what does that really mean? Whatâ€™s with the word â€œconvolutionalâ€? Whatâ€™s so unusual about an image-related problem that a different network is required?</p>
