I"[<p>By now, you’ve probably seen a few, if not many, <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&amp;as_sdt=0%2C5&amp;q=detecting+covid-19+using+neural+network&amp;btnG=">articles</a> on how deep learning could help detect COVID-19. In particular, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have been studied as a faster and cheaper alternative to the gold-standard PCR test by just analyzing the patient’s computed tomography (CT) scan. It’s not surprising since CNN is excellent at image recognition; Many places have CT scanners rather than COVID-19 testing kits (at least initially)[refs].</p>
