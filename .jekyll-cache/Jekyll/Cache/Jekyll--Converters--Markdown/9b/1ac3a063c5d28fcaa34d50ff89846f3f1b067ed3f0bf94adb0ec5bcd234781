I"|<p>I am not a deep learning researcher, but I know a few things about neural networks through various exposures. On the other hand, I’ve always heard that CNN is a type of neural network that’s especially good at the image-related problems. But, what does that really mean? What’s with the word “convolutional”? What’s so different about an image-related problem?</p>
