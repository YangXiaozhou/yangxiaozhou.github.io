I"‰<p>I am not a deep learning researcher, but Iâ€™ve come to know a few things about neural networks through various exposures. On the other hand, Iâ€™ve always heard that CNN is a type of neural network thatâ€™s especially good at the image-related problems. But, what does that really mean? Whatâ€™s with the word â€œconvolutionalâ€? Whatâ€™s so different about an image-related problem?</p>
