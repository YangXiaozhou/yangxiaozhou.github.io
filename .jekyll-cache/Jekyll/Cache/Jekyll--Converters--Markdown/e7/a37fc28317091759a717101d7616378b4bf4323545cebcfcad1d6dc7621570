<h1 id="introduction-to-convolutional-neural-network">Introduction to convolutional neural network</h1>

<p>To get everyone on the same page, I am going to introduce very briefly what are <strong>deep neural networks</strong> (DNNs) and <strong>convolutional neural networks</strong> (CNNs). At the end of this section, you can gain an intuitive understanding of the motivation behind CNN and the key components that define a CNN.</p>

<h2 id="deep-neural-network">Deep neural network</h2>

<p>Before diving into neural networks, let‚Äôs first see the machine learning big picture:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Machine learning</strong> (ML) is the study of computer algorithms that improve automatically through experience. ‚Äì Wikipedia</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Looking at the problems that ML tries to solve, ML is often sliced into</p>
<ul>
  <li>Supervised learning: predicting a label, e.g. classification, or a continuous variable;</li>
  <li>Unsupervised learning: pattern recognition for unlabeled data, e.g., clustering;</li>
  <li>Reinforcement learning: algorithms learn the best way to ‚Äúbehave‚Äù, e.g. AlphaGo, self-driving cars.</li>
</ul>

<p>Deep learning, among others, is a powerful form of machine learning that has garnered much attention for its successes in computer vision (e.g. image recognition), natural language processing, and beyond. DNN is probably the most well-known network for deep learning. From its early conception, neural network is originally inspired by information processing and communication nodes in biological systems. By design, input data is passed through layers of the network, which contain a number of nodes, analogous to ‚Äúneurons‚Äù. The system then outputs a certain representation of the information. DNN systems can be trained to learn the features of the data very well.</p>
