I"ï<p>In this article, Iâ€™ll walk you through the COVID-19 convolutional neural network (CNN) classifier that weâ€™ve built as an entry to the 2020 INFORMS <a href="https://connect.informs.org/HigherLogic/System/DownloadDocumentFile.ashx?DocumentFileKey=f404f7b8-fcd6-75d5-f7a7-d262eab132e7">QSR Data Challenge</a>. This article focuses on the implementation of an end-to-end CNN image classifier using <code class="highlighter-rouge">tensorflow.keras</code>. If you are not familiar with CNN, or would like a refresher on the key features of neural networks and CNNs, I highly recommmend reading <a href="http://yangxiaozhou.github.io/data/2020-09-24-detecting-covid19-based-on-ct-scan.html">Introduction to convolutional neural network</a> first.</p>
