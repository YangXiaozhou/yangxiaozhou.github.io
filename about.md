Hi, I am currently working on my Ph.D. in industrial engineering at National University of Singapore, under the supervision of A/P [Chen Nan](https://www.eng.nus.edu.sg/isem/staff/chen-nan/). I am interested in condition monitoring problems for complex physical systems using data-driven methods. When I am not working, I like running and [cycling](https://www.strava.com/athletes/29332455/). I also go for hiking and scuba diving around South East Asia. 

Growing up, my dad would always tell me that "好记性不如烂笔头", which means that the palest ink is better than the best memory. He is a man of words. I can still remember vividly how he would sit in the living room and write in his journal every night. I am becoming increasingly aware of fact that:
- Writing stuff down forces me to organize and think deeper.
- I tend to naturally forget stuff, concepts, experiences, and so on.
<!-- - I am contributing freely to many UGC-platforms.  -->

So I decided to start this blog and put thoughts down.

I am putting my Strava widget here because I just love the app so much.
