Hi, I am *Yang* Xiaozhou (杨晓州), currently working on my Ph.D. in industrial engineering at National University of Singapore, mentored by A/P [Chen Nan](https://www.eng.nus.edu.sg/isem/staff/chen-nan/). I am also part of the Future Resilient Systems programme at [Singapore-ETH Centre](https://sec.ethz.ch). I am interested in real-time anomaly detection for complex systems using data-driven methods. You can find some of my reseach works [here](https://yangxiaozhou.github.io/publication/). When I am not working, I like cooking, doing [sports](https://www.strava.com/athletes/29332455/) and scuba diving around South East Asia. I also make [videos](https://www.youtube.com/user/a315345751/) about my diving and cycling trips. 

Growing up, my dad would always tell me that "好记性不如烂笔头", which means that the palest ink is better than the best memory. He is a man of words. I can still remember vividly how he would sit in the living room and write in his journal every night. I am becoming increasingly aware of the fact that:
- Writing stuff down forces me to organize and think deeper.
- I tend to quickly forget stuff.
<!-- - I am contributing freely to many UGC-platforms.  -->

So I decided to start this blog where I can put thoughts down and not worry about losing them.
