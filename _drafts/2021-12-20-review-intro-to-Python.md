It seems like everybody is learning how to program and analyze data nowadays. One reason is the  opportunity presented by highly accessible computing power and the ease of capturing data. Another is the advent of massive open online course movement (MOOC) and ensuing online learning platforms. To learn something, we are no longer limited to physical classrooms or print (often expensive) textbooks. Educators from around the world design classes that reach student cohort of millions rather than hundreds, and students can come from incredibly diverse backgrounds. Many of the classes offered teach similar contents; They are in a market and "compete" with each other for better student reviews. 

In this article, I would like to recommend such a MOOC: [Introduction to Python Programming](https://www.edx.org/professional-certificate/introduction-to-python-programming), a four-part course run by Dr. David Joyner from the Georgia Institute of Technology. It is not the most popular course on Python programming; It may not even be in **the top 10 list**. However, I would highly recommend anyone who is or has been learning Python on their own to give this class a try. To quote the course overview:

> The series is designed to take you from no computer science (CS) background whatsoever to proficiency in the basics of computing and programming, specifically in the popular programming language Python. Rated as one of the most in-demand and beginner-friendly programming languages, Python training will give you a solid foundation not only for Python code but for further studies in computer science.

So the questions is, why did I take this course? Certainly, I am not new to programming. I've been introduced to CS foundations through C, C++, and Java in my undergraduate days. I picked up Python for my Bachelor thesis on imbalanced data classification. Ever since then, I've been learning and using Python for the most part of my Ph.D..

However, there are unfortunately not many memories left from my C and C++ classes (I guess it's really use it or lose it); My learning of Python has mostly been sporadic and oriented towards solving something or using something. It was always about programming rather than the bigger picture of computing (This is one of the distinctions that Dr. Joyner makes early in the course). In short, I was looking for a formal introduction to the basics of computing and programming in Python. 

This course does exactly that. Dr. Joyner takes us through essential concepts in computing in a way that feels natural, paced, and yet progressive. Each chapter and subchapter builds on the previous one. I can't applaud enough for Dr. Joyner's delivery neither. He always uses common sense analogies to illustrate a particular computing concept. The result is that we walk away not only knowing how to code, but why. 

What sets this course apart though is the amount of **carefully designed** exercise problems that we get to practice on. For any learning to happen, practice is the key. This course excels on that by providing numerous exercises in each section. Straightforward multiple-choice questions and short coding exercises are provided early in a chapter. As we progress, they become a bit more challenging and yet still completely doable. Each coding exercise is also accompanied by detailed instructions and tips to help anyone in need. Looking back, I would say the videos and texts accounted for 50% of the learning and exercises the remaining 50%. There are many great features of this course that I did not mention, e.g., a companion smart book, real teaching assistants going through exercise problems, all the benefits of a self-paced online course. 

I have learnt about computing as much as I have reviewed in this course. Therefore, I would highly recommend it to anyone currently learning or has learnt Python programming on their own. To close the loop of "read, recite, and review", I tried to write a tutorial for each topic I learn. Rather than a replication of Dr. Joyner's course reading, it is a concise set of notes written to summarize my own understanding. Additional materials are also occasionally added from further reading on the topic. Lastly, I've prepared these tutorials in Jupyter notebooks so that plenty of helpful coding exercises could be run concurrent to the text. My hope is that this set of notebooks can help me and you to quickly review fundamental Python computing concepts and techniques whenever we need in the future.  

You can find all the Jupyter notebooks in this Github [repo](https://github.com/YangXiaozhou/Introduction_to_Python_programming), or go straight to one of them:
