I update the current COVID-19 situation in the US, Europe, and Asia, tracking both the outbreak and any emerging signals of containment. Latest update: {{ site.time | date: '%B %d, %Y' }}. The graphs in this blog are best viewed on Laptop. 

## 1. Prognosis
- **United States**
    - The number of confirmed infections has been increasing by 30% daily for the past few days. This is expected to continue, given the large number of testings being carried out right now ([60K test results](#US Testing Numbers) are pending). 
    - There is an upward trend in the case fatality rate, likely due to an overwhelmed healthcare system.
    - On the upside, though, it seems like people are actively protecting themselves now as the [google search](#Google Search Interest) for "mask" is at an all-time high. 
- **Europe**
    + Europe is probably reaching the end of the tunnel as the number of daily confirmed cases is increasing at a [slower rate every day](#Percentage Change), with Italy, the slowest, at 10%, and Spain, the fastest, at 18%. 
    + The Italian healthcare system faced a grave challenge, with the case fatality rate currently at 10.6% and still increasing. Spain seems to be heading [in the same direction](#case fatality rate) with a 7.8% fatality rate. Germany, though, fares well in this regard and manages to record only a 0.7% fatality rate. 
- **Asia**
    + Most of Asia still seems to have the outbreak under control, especially in places like China, Singapore, Hong Kong, Taiwan, and South Korea. 
    + There's been a surge in the number of imported cases due to mainly home-coming citizens to places like China and Singapore. Governments have imposed stricter quarantine procedures since then. 


## 2. Signals of Containment

<a name="Percentage Change"></a>
### Percentage Change
7-day moving average (MA) of the percentage change in confirmed cases reported in selected countries. It is important to see both the percentage change and the trend of the percentage. To easily classify the situation, we can use the following scale[^percentage]:
- $$r > 100\%$$: **Rapidly increasing**. The total number of cases is doubling everyday.
- $$10\% < r < 100\%$$: **Increasing**. 
- $$1\% < r < 10\%$$: **Slowly increasing**.
- $$r < 1\%$$: **Under control**. There is almost no new case reported.

<a name="Google Search Interest"></a>
### Google Search Interest
This figure tells us how many people in the US are searching for keywords such as "hand sanitizer" or "symptom". I suspect that as the community spread of the virus is being contained, we can expect to see a drop in searches for words like "symptom" and "influenza", similar to the trends shown in Singapore.

<a name="US Testing Numbers"></a>
### US Testing Numbers
As the containment takes effect, we expect to see the number of positive and negative tests stabilize, and the number of tests pending result drops.

[^percentage]: The percentage only indicates a relative change. The actual number of new cases reported in each country may be very different, as it depends on the absolute number of cumulative cases in that country.
