What better way to start a blog than writing about how I actually set this blog up. Because the process is not as straightforward as I though it would be. 

### 1. Set up Jekyll 


### 2. Host it on GitHub


### 3. Tags & Categories


### 4. MathJax

1. Create a `mathjax.html` file
2. Include it in `head.html`
